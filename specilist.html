			<p>There are many types of cancer treatment. The types of treatment that you have will depend on the type of
				cancer you have and how advanced it is. Some people with cancer will have only one treatment. But most
				people have a combination of treatments, such as surgery with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. You
				may also have immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or hormone therapy.</p>

			<p>Clinical trials might also be an option for you. Clinical trials are research studies that involve
				people. Understanding what they are and how they work can help you decide if taking part in a trial is a
				good option for you.</p>

			<p>When you need treatment for cancer, you have a lot to learn and think about. It is normal to feel
				overwhelmed and confused. But, talking with your doctor and learning all you can about all your
				treatment options, including clinical trials, can help you make a decision you feel good about. Our
				Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Treatment may help.</p>

			<p>The treatment for a brain tumor will depend on many things, including the type, size and location of the tumor, as well as your symptoms, general health and treatment preferences. The main treatment options for a brain tumor include:
			</p>
	
				<p><li> Surgery</li>
				<li>Radiation therapy</li>
				<li>Targeted drug therapy</li>
				<li>Tumor treating fields</li>
				<li>Clinical trials</li>
				<li>Follow-up care and rehabilitation</li>
				  </p>

			<p>There is more hope than ever before for people with brain tumors. Research has helped create advanced treatments such as tumor-treating fields and other innovations.</p><p>Treatments for different brain tumors will depend on symptoms, location and biological aggressiveness of the tumor, the extent of possible surgical resection, and the tumor tissue pathology characteristics.</p>

			<p>Liver transplant surgery is a life-saving procedure that replaces a diseased and failing liver with a healthy one. There are many people on the waiting list for a new liver. Those who receive liver transplants are critically ill with no other treatment option. They might have end-stage liver disease, acute liver failure or liver cancer.
			</p>
	
				<p>You can’t live without a functioning liver. If your liver is failing, or if you have primary liver cancer, a liver transplant could save your life. Many things can cause your liver to stop working, including immediate (acute) causes like toxic poisoning and chronic liver diseases. There are many more people who need liver transplants than there are donor livers available.
				  </p>
			<p>It’s usually a last-resort treatment. The competition for donor livers is high, and even if you do get one, it won’t always cure the underlying disease. Some chronic liver diseases will simply resume their destructive work on the new liver. But since these diseases tend to progress slowly, starting over with a healthy liver can buy valuable time. </p>

			<p>Acute liver failure occurs when a previously healthy liver has severe damage. The damage may come from toxic poisoning or infection. If you have acute liver failure, you will have symptoms of liver insufficiency — evidence that your liver has stopped working. This is an emergency. Some livers recover from acute liver failure, but others don't.</p>

			<p>A heart transplant is surgery to remove the diseased heart from a person and replace it with a healthy one from an organ donor. To remove the heart from the donor, two or more healthcare providers must declare the donor brain-dead.
			</p>
	
				<p>Before you can be put on a waiting list for a heart transplant, a healthcare provider makes the decision that this is the best treatment choice for your heart failure. A healthcare team also makes sure you are otherwise healthy enough to go through the transplant process.
				  </p>

			<p>Why might I need a heart transplant?</p>
			<p>You may need a heart transplant if your heart is failing and other treatments are not effective.
				End-stage heart failure is a disease in which the heart muscle is failing severely in its attempt to pump blood through the body. It means other treatments are no longer working. End-stage heart failure is the final stage of heart failure. Despite its name, a diagnosis of heart failure does not mean the heart is about to stop beating. </p>
