				<h1> Kidney Tranplant-adult </h1>
				<p>For patients with compromised kidney function and advanced chronic kidney diseases three treatment options are available- haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or a kidney transplant. Depending on the age and the stage of kidney disease, a nephrologist decides the course of treatment. A successful kidney transplant when indicated, provides a better quality of life as it prevents long-term issues related to dialysis.

					Future Health Multispeciality is one among the top 10 kidney transplant hospitals in India. The best nephrologists from all over India are dedicated to providing comprehensive care and support to kidney patients with their treatment approaches. Each kidney specialist has diverse experience in the field of the kidney transplant procedure and performed kidney transplant procedures in recipients and donors of all ages</p>

				<h1>Critical Care</h1>
				<p> Critical Care medicine is of vital importance for a healthy nation. This speciality will certainly
					reduce the mortality by providing early and appropriate life-saving interventions to all critically
					ill patients.

					We offer 24/7 care to patients in potentially life-threatening conditions who need continuous
					monitoring to be carried out by a multidisciplinary team. potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias, the cumulative
					effects of multiple organ system failure, or even in the crucial hours after major surgeries when
					the patient is deemed too unstable to transfer to a less intensively monitored unit.

				<h1>Blood Bank Services</h1>
				<p> Blood drives life, it’s constantly circulating within the human body ensuring that all essential
					substances like nutrition, oxygen reach all different parts of our body and the cells. An average
					person carries nearly 5 liters of blood, it circulates the body through blood vessels and is pumped
					through the heart.
				</p>
				<p>
					It can never be substituted, regenerated, or manufactured itself. The only source of blood for
					patients who need blood transfusion are blood donors. In general, blood is a combination of plasma
					and cells wherein plasma makes up nearly 55 percent of the blood count. The rest 45 percent is a mix
					of red/white blood cells and platelets.</p>

				<h1>Breast Cancer</h1>
				<p>Cancer takes place when there are changes or mutations in the genes, and these changes trigger cell growth. The mutations allow cells to divide and multiply in an uncontrolled manner. Breast cancer develops when the mutation takes place in the lobules or the ducts; lobules are the milk-producing glands and the ducts are the pathways that provide the milk from the nipple. Cancer will also occur in the fibrous connective tissues in the breast. If the breast cancer symptoms are not detected in the early stages then it can spread to healthy tissues or fibrous connective tissues in the breast. The cancer spreads through lymph nodes, which happen to be the primary pathway for the disease.</p>

				<h1>Dental Science</h1>
				<p>
					Years ago, a physician who suspected heart disease in you probably did not refer you to a gum specialist. Times have changed. The past years have seen increasing links between oral health and body health.

Visiting a dentist is as necessary as consulting a cardiologist for your heart health. We do tend to ignore our oral care because we feel it is not as crucial as our kidney, heart, liver. Remember, by doing so, you are playing with your health.

Teeth are a very important part of the body because good health starts with good oral health. General well-being is associated with good oral health. New research has shown a close relation between Periodontal Diseases and Cardiac Diseases.
				</p>

				<h1>Diabetology</h1>
				<p>
					Narayana Health is one of the best diabetes hospitals in India for diabetic screenings and diabetes or prediabetes treatment. Our team of expert diabetologists and trained medical staff offer high-quality care for the various stages and types of diabetes.

It is estimated that today more than 62 million Indians suffer from diabetes as of now and the numbers are projected to touch 100 million by 2035 if not provided proper treatment for diabetes.

				<h1>Pharmacy and Diagnosis</h1>
				<p>

					Most hospitals in India do maintain a pharmacy and diagnostic department of their own. This is a
					very important segment as easy and quick availability of medicines and other equipment required for
					treatment procedure is vital to render best healing services. </p>
				<p>

					However, many a times, hospitals do not guarantee the availability of all medicines that are being
					prescribed and therefore independent pharmacies are equally important. Further, 9 out of 10
					hospitals maintain a separate laboratory and diagnostic section where related tests can be carried
					out. Again, similar to pharmacies, these diagnostic departments do not offer wide variety of test
					and analysis for patients.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div class="right">
				<h1>Intensive Care Unit(ICU):</h1>
				<p>
					Almost every hospital in India provides ICU facilities for patients suffering from adverse health
					conditions. ICUs need to be equipped with modern technical apparatus and skilled professionals who
					can render best services. Depending on the type of hospital and services they focus on, there can be
					different types of ICUs. Some of them are, Neuro ICU, Coronary Care Unit, Neonatal ICU, Psychiatric
					ICU etc.</p>

				<h1>Out patient Department( OPD)</h1>
				<p>

					Every hospital needs to have an OPD (Outpatient Department) as one of the core services rendered. A
					set of skilled doctors along with technicians must be available, who can assist patients in
					preliminary diagnosis and related treatments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors prescribe medicines or diagnostic tests to evaluate patient’s health condition. They are
					also required to be available for follow up visits to monitor conditions and treatment procedures.
					Depending on the response, patients are either asked for admission or specialized services such as
					surgeries.

				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<h1> Nursing </h1>
				<p>

					Nurses employed by hospitals function as connecting bridges between doctors and the patients they
					treat. Nurses look after the overall well being of patients. They ensure that all health related
					instructions given by doctors are implemented and followed by patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nurses are employed in different departments within hospitals. Specialised hospitals hire trained
					nurses who are technically sound to perform advanced tasks relevant to diagnosis, treatment and care
					of sick ones.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every hospital therefore has a separate nursing department which forms a core segment of
					hospitalisation.
