 <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Term and  Uses Policy</h1>
 <h2>Health policy</h2>
 AME journals use an exclusive licensing agreement. For submission to any AME journal, the corresponding author of the article must agree to transfer copyright and assign all rights to the submitted article (and any revisions or versions of it) solely to the journal, to print, publish, distribute, and sell the article in all languages and media internationally. The transfer of copyright is deemed in effect if and when the submitted article is accepted for publication. If the submitted article contains any material already protected by prior copyright, the corresponding author must deliver written permission from the copyright holder for the reproduction of the material in the article to the journal’s editorial office.

 
 The corresponding author must certify and warrant that he/she is the author and proprietor of the article and that he/she has not granted or assigned any of the article’s rights to any other person or body. The author must warrant that the article is copyrightable and that it does not infringe upon any pre-existing copyright, trademark, or patent. The author must warrant that the article does not invade the right of privacy of any person(s) or entity, that it does not include any defamatory contents, and that all statements presented as facts are true or based upon accurate research. The author must warrant that no procedure or treatment described within the article would cause injury, if followed in accordance with the instructions and warnings of the article.
 
 The corresponding author must compensate the journal for any costs, expenses, or damages that the Company may incur as a result of any breach of these warranties. The corresponding author further absolves the journal’s Editor(s)-in-Chief, and the Editorial Board and Team of any legal liability with respect to any and all statements made in the manuscript, including, but not limited to, any intentional or unintentional errors, omissions, copyright issues, or plagiarism. These may be extended to third parties by the journal.
 

 
    <h2>Permission</h2>
 
 Permission to reproduce copyright material, for print and online publication in perpetuity, must be cleared, and if necessary, paid for by the author; this may include applications and payments to DACS, ARS, and similar licensing agencies. Evidence in writing that such permissions have been secured from the right holder must be made available to the editors. It is also the author’s responsibility to include acknowledgments as stipulated by the particular institutions. Please note that obtaining copyright permission could take some time. For a copyright prose work, it is recommended that permission is obtained for: the use of an extract longer than 400 words; a series of extracts totaling more than 800 words, of which any one is an extract of more than 300 words; or an extract or series of extracts comprising one-quarter of the work or more.
 
 All AME journals content is published Open Access under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). All open access articles published will be immediately and permanently free for everyone to read, download, copy, and distribute as defined by the applied license.
 
 For usage outside of the terms stated within the applied license, such as commercial usage, permission must be obtained via the publishing house. Please contact: permissions@amegroups.com.
 <h2>Dangerous copyright proposals hit medical community hard</h2>
 If one were to ask the average physician to name imminent policy reforms relevant to the medical profession, copyright law is not among those topics most likely to leap to mind. This may soon change: the Canadian government is contemplating dramatic copyright reforms that could have a detrimental impact on medical research and education. If the medical community fails to speak up on these issues, it will do so at its own peril.
 <br>
<p>
Patent and copyright law share the same basic objective: to balance the interests of inventors and creators with those of the general public. In the case of patents, inventors are typically granted a limited 20-year monopoly over their invention. In return, the public receives immediate access to a full description of the invention and the right to use the patent, without condition, on its expiry.<br></p>
<p>
Copyright features a similar balance. Authors obtain copyright in their work automatically without registration and benefit from a basket of time-limited exclusive rights, including the right to reproduce and translate their work. The public benefits from a series of “user rights” that allow for the copying of portions of the work for research or private study without prior permission as well as unfettered access once copyright in the work expires. (This is known as entering the public domain.)<br></p>
<p>
Researchers can be forgiven if they occasionally believe that the balance is skewed heavily toward rights holders. One such example concerns Myriad Genetics, a Utah-based company that holds patents on diagnostic tests and treatments involving breast cancer genes. The company has entered into licences with medical schools, universities and hospitals, giving them the right to use their tests in research on breast cancer. These licences have faced growing criticism, however, as medical school researchers are forced to abandon their work because of licensing terms that exclude clinical research by restricting research to a laboratory setting.<br></p>
<p>
Copyright law is slated to undergo changes in Canada that will provide rights holders with similar strangleholds over their content, to the detriment of the medical research community.
</p><br><p>
One of the most troubling copyright proposals concerns technological protection measures (TPMs), which are used by owners of online databases and other digital content to establish a layer of technical protection that prevents users from making unauthorized copies of their work. For example, popular medical texts designed for handheld electronic devices such as the Palm contain TPMs that restrict use of the electronic books in ways not found in the paper-based versions of the same texts.<br>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, TPMs are blunt instruments that block both the full-scale unauthorized copying that is expressly denied by copyright law and limited copying, such as copying short passages for research purposes. (For example, CBS News recently released a 234-page report on the use of unverified documents in relation to a report on President Bush's military service. Critics soon noticed that the document featured technological limitations that prevented users from “cutting and pasting” even a single sentence.)<br></p>
<p>
The legislative proposal, which comes as part of a move to ratify 2 controversial international copyright treaties, adds to the dangers associated with TPMs by providing an additional layer of protection that prohibits attempts to circumvent or defeat the technological protection measure. In the United States, this layer of protection has criminalized attempts to access research data protected by a TPM, even if the intended use is itself lawful under copyright law. In their zeal to enact similar legislation in Canada, policy-makers may use the US approach as their model.
</p><br><p>
Consider the potential impact on genetic research. Researchers seeking to obtain access to proprietary genetic databases could be forced to negotiate a licence from the database owner, despite user rights that would otherwise grant the right to access and use selected portions of the database content without prior approval.
</p>
The proposed copyright reforms also pose a significant threat to the dissemination of research results, particularly research with a security component.
