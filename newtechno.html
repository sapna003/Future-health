					<h2>CT (Computed Tomography) Scan</h2>
					<p>Doctors and other healthcare professionals have years of training in their field, but there are
						still many things they can’t diagnose simply by looking at or listening to your body.

						Certain medical conditions require a deeper look, usually at the tissues, blood vessels, and
						bones inside your body. X-rays and ultrasounds can provide some information, but when a more
						detailed view is required, a computed tomography (CT) scan is usually the next step.

						In this article, we take a closer look at how a CT scan works, what it’s typically used for, and
						what the procedure is like. </p>

					<h2>Ventilator</h2>
					<p>You may be put on a mechanical ventilator, also known as a breathing machine, if a condition
						makes it very difficult for you to breathe or get enough oxygen into your blood. This condition
						is called respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilators are machines that act as bellows to move
						air in and out of your lungs. Your respiratory therapist and doctor set the ventilator to
						control how often it pushes air into your lungs and how much air you get. </p>
					<p>

						You may be fitted with a mask to get air from the ventilator into your lungs. Or you may need a
						breathing tube if your breathing problem is more serious. When you’re ready to be taken off the
						ventilator, your healthcare team will “wean” you or decrease the ventilator support until you
						can start breathing on your own.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mechanical ventilators are mainly used in hospitals and in transport systems such as ambulances
						and MEDEVAC air transport etc. In some cases, they can be used at home, if the illness is long
						term and the caregivers at home receive training and have adequate nursing and other resources
						in the home. Being on a ventilator may make you more susceptible to pneumonia, damage to your
						vocal cords, or other risks or problems. </p>

					<h2>X-Ray Machine</h2>
					<p>X-ray machines are X-ray imaging devices. X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that has
						been used in the medical field for many years now. This technology has proven to be very
						effective at showing us images of our internal organs such as lungs, heart, and even bones.
					</p>
					<p> We can also define X-ray machines as X-ray production devices that allow X-rays to be produced.
						The X-rays will then hit an X-ray receptor found on the X-ray screen, which then transforms the
						X-ray into a visible image that you can see using your eyes. </p>
					<p>The X-ray machine is also used in airport security and other security systems. In addition, x-ray
						machines are the most used in dental X-rays to determine cavities, infections, and cracks on
						your teeth.</p>
					<p>How does X-ray Machine Work?</p>
					<p>
						The X-ray tubes in the X-ray machine works by accelerating electrons under high voltage. These
						electrons will cause the breaking of atomic bonds, so it continuously releases electromagnetic
						radiation. This radiation causes further collisions with other atoms in its path. These types of
						collisions result in the emission of more X –rays and gamma rays. X-Ray screens are made from
						materials such as molybdenum or tungsten.</p>
